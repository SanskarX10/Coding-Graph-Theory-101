    "### Connected Graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is said to be connected if there is a path between connecting every pair of nodes or vertices.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Graphs can be connected and disconnected. This means that the graph is constructed out of two or more sub-graphs without a path between these components.\n",

    "\n",
    "A directed graph, also called a digraph, is a graph in which the edges have a direction. This is usually indicated with an arrow on the edge \n",
    "In a directed graph, we represent an edge from i to j as pair(i,j).  The formal description of a directed graph G is (V,E) where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Undirected Graph:\n",
    "\n",

    "In a directed graph or a digraph, each edge is associated with a direction from a start vertex to an end vertex. If we traverse along the direction of the edges and we find that no closed loops are formed along any path, we say that there are no directed cycles. The graph formed is a directed acyclic graph.\n",

    "Mathematically , A graph G=(V, E) is called a bipartite graph if its vertices V can be partitioned into two subsets V1 and V2 such that each edge of G connects a vertex of V1 to a vertex V2. It is denoted by Kmn, where m and n are the numbers of vertices in V1 and V2 respectively.\n",
